abstract="Spiking neural P systems with inhibitory synapses (ISN P systems, for short) are a class of discrete neural-like computing models, which are inspired by the way of biological neurons storing and processing information and communication by means of excited and inhibitory impulses. In this work, we prove that ISN P systems can compute and accept any set of Turing computable numbers by using one type of neurons, thus can achieve Turing universality. Such systems are called homogenous ISN P systems. The results give a positive answer to an open problem left in (Pan and P{\u{a}}un, Int J Comput Commun 4(3):273--282, 2009) that ``whether the number of types of neurons in universal SN P systems can be decreased by using inhibitory synapses''. The obtained result is optimal in the sense of having minimal number of types of neurons in Turing universal SN P systems.",

abstract="Spiking neural P systems with anti-spikes (ASN P systems, for short) are a class of neural-like computing models in membrane computing, which are inspired by neurons communication through both excitatory and inhibitory impulses (spikes). In this work, we consider a restricted variant of ASN P systems, called homogeneous ASN P systems, where any neuron has the same set of spiking and forgetting rules. As a result, we prove that such systems can achieve Turing completeness. Specifically, it is proved that two categories of pure form of spiking rules (for a spiking rule, if the language corresponding to the regular expression that controls its application is exactly the form of spikes consumed by the rule, then the rule is called pure) are sufficient to compute and accept the family of sets of Turing computable natural numbers.",
